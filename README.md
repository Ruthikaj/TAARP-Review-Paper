APPLICATIONS


   
Defence Forces

The project can be implemented in battle field or high altitude areas where health and location of soldiers is the most basic information which should be known to the control room.

Civilians

This project can also be utilized by individuals who work in remote areas or high altitudes wherein the most basic information should be known to someone dear to them or their guardianâ€™s.
