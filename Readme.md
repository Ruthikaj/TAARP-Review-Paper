Military personnel are frequently subjected to harsh environments and dangerous situations that endanger
their safety and well-being. Traditional communication systems, such as radio transmission, have range and power consumption restrictions,
making them less suitable for military purposes. To solve these issues, a LoRa-based smart soldier jacket is proposed as a solution. 
This device is intended to capture and transmit real-time data on soldiers vital signs, movements, locations, and 
environmental conditions via the LoRa module, which is a low-power, long range, LPWA modulation technology.
